# Roadmap — WLM‑World‑Generation‑Protocol  
**From MVP → spatial/temporal/causal worlds → full generative universes**

This roadmap outlines the evolution of WLM‑World‑Generation‑Protocol  
from a minimal deterministic generator  
into a full structural world‑generation system.

---

# Phase 1 — MVP (Current)
**Goal:** Establish a deterministic world‑generation pipeline.

### Deliverables
- seed engine  
- region engine (stub)  
- entity engine (stub)  
- rule engine (stub)  
- timeline engine (stub)  
- world graph builder  
- CLI  
- documentation  

### Success Criteria
- deterministic world graph generation  
- clean extension points  

---

# Phase 2 — Spatial World Generation
**Goal:** Generate real spatial topology.**

### Deliverables
- region graph generation  
- topology constraints  
- navigable maps  

### Success Criteria
- spatially coherent worlds  

---

# Phase 3 — Entity & Faction Systems
**Goal:** Populate worlds with entities.**

### Deliverables
- entity templates  
- faction systems  
- resource networks  

### Success Criteria
- worlds become populated and interactive  

---

# Phase 4 — Physical & Causal Rule Systems
**Goal:** Add world logic.**

### Deliverables
- physical constraints  
- causal propagation  
- systemic rule networks  

### Success Criteria
- worlds become consistent and dynamic  

---

# Phase 5 — Timeline & Narrative Engine
**Goal:** Add world evolution and story structure.**

### Deliverables
- event chains  
- causal timelines  
- narrative arcs  

### Success Criteria
- worlds become alive and evolving  

---

# Phase 6 — Simulation‑Ready Worlds
**Goal:** Produce worlds ready for agent‑based simulation.**

### Deliverables
- world graph with edges  
- agent‑ready interfaces  
- real‑time world updates  

### Success Criteria
- <50ms world updates  
- stable simulation under change  

---

# Summary

WLM‑World‑Generation‑Protocol evolves through:

1. MVP — deterministic generation  
2. Spatial topology  
3. Entity systems  
4. Causal rule systems  
5. Narrative engine  
6. Simulation‑ready worlds  

This transforms WLM from **structured cognition**  
into **structured creation**.
